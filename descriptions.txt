# Enemies
phyrexian_mite: The Phyrexian Mite is a small but deadly creature from the plane of Phyrexia. It has a metallic carapace that covers its entire body and a set of sharp mandibles that it uses to bite its prey. The mite is extremely agile and can move quickly across any surface, making it difficult to catch or avoid. It is a carrier of Phyrexian oil, which it uses to infect other creatures and spread the Phyrexian corruption.
abyss_watcher: The Abyss Watchers, the legendary warriors of Farron's Undead Legion, are the stuff of nightmares. They are the ultimate bros, always ready to party, but once they put on their fancy red cloaks and unsheathe their fiery swords, they transform into a fearsome pack of frat boys on a rampage. They fight with the precision of synchronized swimmers, and their coordination is so tight, you'll think you're watching a dance routine. And when they start summoning their spectral buddies to the dance floor, you'll know it's time to get serious.

# Weapons
cursed_longsword: What is going on... Bent over, clutching your knees and out of breath, you see through teary eyes a blade. Right in front of your feet the shiny metal is glistening in the sun. Strange runes shine and disappear as quickly as they have appeared under your gaze. Their purple shade almost gives off a glowing nuance. It can't glow, can it? What is this strange weapon? Overwhelmed with deadly curiosity you pick up the blade.To your surprise it is light as a feather. You chuckle. You are most assuredly dreaming. Any moment now, you will wake up in your soft, warm bed and forget all about this cursed land. You try to throw away the sword, but like a clingy ex,it just won't let go. Like a lost puppy it clings to you side. No matter how hard you try to get rid of it,it magically reappears by your side like a creepy stalker.Any moment now... you will wake up and laugh at this nonsensical dream you just had...
the_lute-nuke: There should be something useful around here... Looking around frantically for a while, you quickly lose patience and collapse on the ground in despair. Why is it always you?Why is life always so cruel towards you? What have you ever done to deserve such a destiny. Always the victim..Thinking about all the times people and life didn't treat you right, you stare unconsciously at the tree crownsBeautiful shades of blue light are dancing on the velvety green leaves.This distracts you for a moment from your constant whining of how unfair life is.Is there water nearby? What are these reflections on the tree leaves?Immediately you jump to your feet and spin around.And there it is! A magnificent lute! Masterfully sculpted, beautifully painted with all shades of sparkling blue.You take it into your hands still in awe... Maybe life isn't so bad after all.
makeshift_staff: You see something purple buried in the dirt.Wondering what it is, you stretch your hand and sweep some of the dirt away. It looks like an ancient book.Could this be a powerful artefact from long forgotten ages containing mighty incantations...This could save you. You could quickly go back to you boring, but convenient life and never again deal with this horrid creatures.You dig excitedly and quickly remove the rest of the dirt, pulling something long attached to the worn-out book.Your heart sinks. You are staring at an old library-book duct-taped to a broom handle.Is this some kind of joke? Strapping two pieces of garbage together is not solid weapon design...Whoever designed this junk did a poor job indeed

# Potions
health_potion: Fiery Ingwer Shot - blood rushing to your face, watery eyes, flaming mouth and nostrils are common side effects of chugging Ingwer shots uncontrollably
mana_potion: Double espresso - do you want to be overwhelmed with infinite energy? You will be able to talk so fast, nobody will be able to understand what you are blabbering on about. Definitely useful if you want to quickly cast some spells on unsuspecting enemies

# Special Attacks
earworm: Earworm - You start humming a catchy tune and infects the enemy with an earworm, causing them to become distracted and unable to focus. The enemy takes damage as their mind is consumed by the incessant melody.
fireball_barrage: Fireball Barrage - Summon a rain of fireballs from the sky, because why not make it rain fire?
flame_tsunami: Flame Tsunami - Summon a massive wave of fire that will engulf everything in its path, because sometimes subtlety is overrated
gladiators_gambit: Gladiator's Gambit - The gladiator intentionally loses the first few rounds of the fight to lull the opponent into a false sense of security, then delivers a surprise attack when they least expect it.
rick_roll: Rick Roll - this attack is a powerful and devastating technique that can completely disorient and distract enemies. Beware, though - this attack is not for the faint of heart, as you'll need to have a certain level of swag and style to pull it off properly.
spin_to_win: Spin To Win - Turn you panic-stricken daze into a deadly weapon
